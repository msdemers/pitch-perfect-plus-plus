# pitch-perfect-plus-plus

This is a simple iOS app for recording a short soundbite and playing it back with modifications. You can control the speed and pitch of playback using buttons and sliders. This work is an augmentation of, and homage to, the Pitch Perfect app designed for Udacity's course Intro to iOS App Development in Swift (https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-ios-app-development-with-swift--ud585). My additions include:
- mix both speed and pitch changes during playback (as apposed to controlling one at a time)
- slider control of speed and pitch
- button quick selection/quick play of maximum and minimum speed and pitch.
- display of current speed and pitch values as text.
- quick reset to original speed or pitch by tapping value indicators (really buttons)
